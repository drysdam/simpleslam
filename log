Google "SLAM for dummies" for SLAM algorithm itself.

Need the following objects for sim:

  World: a place for the sim to occur inside of. this object contains
         the true map of the space and also knows the true position of
         the Robot. the Robot asks the World for measurements. the
         World takes perfect measurements of the map based on the
         Robot's true position (which the robot does not necessarily
         know), then adds a (configurable) amount of noise.
	 
  Robot: has the ability to move around the World and also probe it
         for data via lidar. initially has no idea where it is, but is
         building a Map.

  Map: contains the SLAM implementation and thus will build up
       knowledge of the World and the Robot's position.
